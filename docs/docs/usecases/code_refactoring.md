## Intelligent Code Refactoring

**Use Case:**
Automating code refactoring for enhanced performance and readability with minimal developer intervention.

**Description:**
Utilize Rusty Buddy to analyze codebases for areas where refactoring could improve performance or readability. The tool can suggest optimal refactorings, focusing on patterns such as loop unrolling, parallel operations, or modular decomposition.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Conduct a comprehensive code analysis to identify complex or underperforming code segments.
- Use personas to target language-specific optimizations (e.g., using Rustâ€™s pattern matching for code clarity).
- Automatically refactor identified code segments, maintaining original functionalities.
- Run tests to ensure correctness post-refactoring.

**Outcome:**
Delivers clearer, more efficient code with potential performance gains, enhancing maintainability and future feature integration.
