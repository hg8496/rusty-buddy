# Leveraging Knowledge for Real-time API Testing

## Use Case
Kickstarting tests with OpenAI's bleeding-edge real-time API by utilizing knowledge entries directly from GitHub.

### Description
In this scenario, Rusty Buddy was utilized to enhance the development process by incorporating real-time API features as a knowledge base. 
The realtime API is bleeding edge and the AI Models do not yet know it.
By downloading a pioneering example project from GitHub, it enabled quick integration and testing of the OpenAI real-time API using Rust.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Adding Knowledge to Database:**
    - The URL content was added to the Rusty Buddy knowledge database using the following command:
```bash
rusty-buddy knowledge add --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/64bit/async-openai/refs/heads/main/examples/realtime/src/main.rs
```

2. **Utilizing the Knowledge:**
    - With the example in the knowledge database, it became accessible during interactive chat sessions.
    - Rusty Buddy could then provide insights, guidance, or even generate a demo program using this newly added knowledge.

3. **Creating a Rust Demo:**
    - Rusty Buddy combined the stored knowledge with AI capabilities to craft a demo program in Rust, showcasing how the newly added knowledge could be practically applied.

### Outcome

By leveraging the knowledge subcommand, the user quickly incorporated a bleeding-edge real-time API example, enabling a faster 
initiation of tests and development. Rusty Buddy facilitated an enriched programming experience by providing contextual support and 
generating example code on demand, thereby accelerating the learning and integration process.

This use case exemplifies how real-time access to the most current examples and information can streamline testing and development 
workflows, harnessing the full potential of AI-driven assistance.
