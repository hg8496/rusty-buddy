# Real-time AI-assisted Debugging

**Use Case:**
Incorporating real-time AI insights into debugging workflows to shortcut learning curves and reduce error identification time.

**Description:**
Integrate Rusty Buddyâ€™s AI capabilities into the debugging process, allowing developers to engage in a dialogue with the assistant while diagnosing bugs, thereby receiving contextually relevant suggestions and explanations.

**Implementation Steps:**
- During debugging sessions, input suspicious code segments or error messages into the chat.
- Rusty Buddy provides insights, potential causes, and debugging pathways informed by similar cases and best practices.
- Employ indirect questioning to hone in on specific debugging represents a streamlined diagnosis process.

**Outcome:**
Accelerates problem-solving by presenting suggested fixes and educating developers on best practices and frequent issues within the same context.
