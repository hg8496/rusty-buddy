# AI-driven Test Case Generation

**Use Case:**
Automating the generation of comprehensive test cases covering edge scenarios and exceptional pathways.

**Description:**
Employ Rusty Buddy to automatically generate test cases, focusing on edge conditions and exception paths that are often overlooked, to rigorously validate code robustness.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Scan the codebase to identify crucial functions and modules needing test coverage.
- Use personas to specify language-appropriate testing frameworks and methodologies.
- Generate unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, ensuring coverage of functional boundaries and potential exception routes.
- Integrate generated tests into the build process, enabling continuous validation of code changes.

**Outcome:**
Proactively uncovers issues before they affect users, strengthening software reliability and accelerating the testing phase in the development lifecycle.
