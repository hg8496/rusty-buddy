//! This module defines the `CommitMessageArgs` struct, which holds the command-line arguments
//! related to generating commit messages in the Rusty Buddy application.
//!
//! It utilizes the `clap` library for parsing, providing a clear interface for users specifying
//! how they want to generate commit messages from their staged changes.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `CommitMessageArgs` struct currently does not include any specific fields or options,
//! serving as a placeholder for future enhancements to support additional parameters or flags
//! related to the commit message generation process.
//!
//! Users can benefit from automatically generated commit messages that follow best practices
//! by utilizing this command. As the application evolves, this struct may be expanded to include
//! more sophisticated features related to commit message generation.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here's a basic example of how you might define command-line arguments using `CommitMessageArgs`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::cli::commitmessage::CommitMessageArgs;
//! use clap::Parser;
//!
//! let args = CommitMessageArgs::parse();
//! // Use args as needed for generating commit messages
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, `CommitMessageArgs` is parsed from the command line, allowing users to
//! provide input that can customize the commit message generation process.

use clap::Args;

#[derive(Args)]
pub struct CommitMessageArgs;
