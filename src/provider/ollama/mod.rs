//! This module provides an interface for integrating with the Ollama AI backend,
//! enabling communication with AI models for chat interactions within the Rusty Buddy application.
//!
//! The `OllamaInterface` struct encapsulates the functionality to send and receive messages
//! to and from the Ollama AI model, implementing the `ChatBackend` trait to ensure compatibility
//! with the chat service. Users can initialize the interface with the desired model and
//! specify the backend URL, ensuring flexible configurations for various deployment scenarios.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//! - **Message Conversion:** The module converts custom message types into the format required
//!   by the Ollama API, allowing seamless communication between the chat service and the AI model.
//!
//! - **User Interaction:** Handles the sending and receiving of messages, providing the necessary
//!   infrastructure to maintain a conversational context.
//!
//! - **Customizable Settings:** Users can specify the model to be used and the URL of the Ollama service,
//!   ensuring the interface is adaptable to different requirements.
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//! ```rust
//! use crate::provider::ollama::ollama_interface::OllamaInterface;
//!
//! let ollama_backend = OllamaInterface::new("llama2".to_string(), None);
//! // Here “llama2” is an example model name
//! ```
//!
//! ## Error Handling
//! This module utilizes `Result` types throughout its methods, allowing for error propagation
//! and ensuring that the user can handle issues gracefully during interactions with the AI.
//!
//! Make sure all interactions with AI models are properly wrapped in error handling to avoid
//! unexpected panics or failures during runtime.
