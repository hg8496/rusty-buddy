//! This module defines a messaging system tailored for chat applications,
//! facilitating interactions between users and an AI assistant. It includes 
//! message types and interfaces to send messages and manage chat sessions.
//! Utilizing the `async_trait` for asynchronous operations, alongside the 
//! `serde` library for serialization and deserialization, the system supports 
//! extensible message handling and session management.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **Message**: 
//!   Encapsulates the message's role (e.g., User, Assistant) and its content. 
//!   It also includes optional metadata through the `MessageInfo` struct, 
//!   which provides context about the message's origin and associated details.
//!
//! - **MessageRole**: 
//!   An enum that defines different roles a message may assume (e.g., System, User, Assistant), 
//!   allowing for clear distinction and handling of messages based on who authored them.
//!
//! - **MessageInfo**: 
//!   A structure containing additional contextual information about the message, including 
//!   the timestamp of creation and various model-related metadata. This aids in analytics 
//!   and debugging within chat sessions.
//!
//! - **ChatBackend**: 
//!   A trait that provides an interface for sending messages to a chat model asynchronously. 
//!   It facilitates the implementation of various backends, enabling flexible integrations 
//!   with models (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama).
//!
//! - **ChatStorage**: 
//!   A trait that facilitates management of chat sessions. It allows for loading, saving, 
//!   and listing chat sessions, ensuring state persistence across application runs.
//!
